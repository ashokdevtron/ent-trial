**Objective:** Track user actions and system changes for better accountability.

**Why this matters:** Transparency and traceability are crucial for regulated or high-scale environments.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Explore Audit Logs**  
   - Access Devtronâ€™s audit dashboard to see user activities across pipelines and environments.

2. **Review Access Logs**  
   - Check logs for `kubectl` access, approvals, and configuration edits.

3. **Link to External Tools**  
   - Set up log forwarding to external observability tools (optional).

**Outcome:** You now have visibility into all user and system activity for compliance and audit needs.
