# Day 5: Multi-Service Deployment

**Objective:** Manage multiple microservices and scale Devtron usage.

**Why this matters:** Most modern applications are composed of many microservices. Being able to manage and deploy them in unison boosts efficiency.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Create an Application Group**  
   - Navigate to the application grouping feature.
   - Organize related services under a single logical group.

2. **Clone Applications Across Environments**  
   - Use the cloning feature to replicate apps into new environments.
   - Apply consistent configurations through patch strategies.

3. **Deploy Multiple Services Together**  
   - Use bulk deployment to push updates to several services simultaneously.

4. **Hibernate & Unhibernate Services**  
   - Use the group control panel to hibernate unused services.
   - Unhibernate them when needed to resume operations.

**Outcome:** Youâ€™ll streamline microservices deployment and reduce manual work through smart grouping and bulk actions.
