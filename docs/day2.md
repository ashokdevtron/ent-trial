# Day 2: Application Bootstrapping

**Objective:** Deploy your first application using Devtron’s pre-built templates.

**Why this matters:** Getting an application up and running quickly builds confidence and helps you understand Devtron’s CI/CD capabilities.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Select a Sample Application Template**  
   - Navigate to the "Create App" section.
   - Choose a predefined sample template that includes CI and CD pipelines.

2. **Configure Basic Settings**  
   - Name your application.
   - Enter your container registry credentials.
   - Set the Git repository if applicable.

3. **Add Configuration Data**  
   - Create a ConfigMap with environment-specific settings.
   - Add a Kubernetes Secret if needed for sensitive values.

4. **Build & Deploy**  
   - Initiate the CI pipeline to build your container image.
   - On successful build, proceed to deploy using the CD pipeline.

**Outcome:** By the end of Day 2, you’ll have a live application deployed via Devtron’s pipelines and your configurations securely in place.
