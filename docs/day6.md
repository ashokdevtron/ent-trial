# Day 6: Observability & Debugging

**Objective:** Detect and resolve issues effectively using Devtron’s built-in observability tools.

**Why this matters:** Real-time debugging saves hours of developer effort and keeps your services healthy.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Access Logs & Events**  
   - Inspect live logs for individual pods.
   - Review recent events tied to application state changes.

2. **Capture Restart Snapshots**  
   - Use the snapshot tool to capture container states before restart.

3. **Inject and Resolve Test Issues**  
   - Simulate failure scenarios.
   - Use AI-based suggestions (if enabled) to identify the root cause.

4. **Reset Overrides**  
   - Reset temporary override configurations to default values.

**Outcome:** You’ll gain confidence in handling production issues through accessible debugging and diagnostics.
