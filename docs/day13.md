# Day 13: Advanced Configuration Management

**Objective:** Standardize and scale configuration across teams and environments.

**Why this matters:** As the number of apps and environments grows, consistency in configuration becomes essential.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Define Scoped Variables**  
   - Create config variables scoped by environment or app.

2. **Use Base Templates & Patch Strategy**  
   - Define a base configuration shared across environments.
   - Apply patches only where needed to override values.

3. **Templatize Configurations**  
   - Use YAML anchors and Devtron-native variables to reduce repetition.

**Outcome:** Your Devtron setup supports reusable, manageable configurations for any scale.
