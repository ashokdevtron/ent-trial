# Day 4: CI/CD Maturity

**Objective:** Implement advanced CI/CD features to streamline delivery.

**Why this matters:** Maturing your pipelines increases reliability, enables compliance, and saves developer time.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Set Sequential & Parallel Pipelines**  
   - Add a new CI stage that includes unit tests.
   - Configure CD to deploy to UAT and production in sequence or parallel.

2. **Add Plugins**  
   - Insert SonarQube as a pre-CI plugin.
   - Explore options for other pre/post-CD integrations.

3. **Approval Workflows**  
   - Define policies requiring manual approval for config changes and deployments.

4. **Filter Views**  
   - Use environment filters to declutter the dashboard and focus on specific deployments.

**Outcome:** Youâ€™ll have a robust and maintainable pipeline setup with built-in safeguards.
