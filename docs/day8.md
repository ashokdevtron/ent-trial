# Day 8: Resource & Helm Management

**Objective:** Understand how Devtron helps manage Kubernetes resources and Helm charts at scale.

**Why this matters:** Centralized visibility and control over resources and charts make operations more predictable and repeatable.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Browse Kubernetes Resources**  
   - Use the "Resource Browser" to explore live resource statuses.
   - Filter by namespace, workload type, or status.

2. **Explore Chart Store**  
   - Visit the "Chart Store" to find pre-integrated Helm charts.
   - Launch apps using customizable chart values.

3. **Use Chart Groups & Presets**  
   - Bundle charts into logical groups.
   - Apply preset values for consistent deployments.

**Outcome:** Youâ€™ll gain control over infrastructure components using reusable charts and detailed live resource data.
