# Day 7: Security Setup

**Objective:** Secure your deployments with Devtronâ€™s policy enforcement and scanning tools.

**Why this matters:** Security is non-negotiable. Blocking vulnerable images and enforcing policies prevents incidents before they occur.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Enable Image Scanning**  
   - Activate security scans via the settings panel.
   - Scan all base and app images for vulnerabilities.

2. **Review Scan Results**  
   - Access detailed vulnerability reports.
   - Understand severity levels and recommended fixes.

3. **Apply Release Policies**  
   - Create rules to block image promotion based on vulnerability severity.

4. **Set Blackout Windows**  
   - Define time windows during which deployments should be restricted (e.g., weekends, freeze periods).

**Outcome:** Your pipelines are now security-aware, enforcing safe practices automatically.
