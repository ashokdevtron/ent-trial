# Day 11: Plugin Policies & Build Optimization

**Objective:** Maximize build efficiency with plugin policies and resource-aware pipelines.

**Why this matters:** Cost and performance optimization help scale Devtron for larger teams and workloads.

**What you'll do:**

1. **Use Plugin Policies**  
   - Apply restrictions on plugin execution based on environment, branch, or team.

2. **Enable Ephemeral Environments**  
   - Spin up disposable environments for test deployments.

3. **Analyze Resource Recommendations**  
   - View performance and cost suggestions for builds and environments.

**Outcome:** Your pipeline is now optimized for cost, performance, and governance.
